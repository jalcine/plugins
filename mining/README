Wintermute's Data Mining API (WntrMining)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This subproject consists of the Wintermute Data Mining API (WntrMining). It provides
the abstract classes required to have an efficient data mining interface and backend,
as well as a means to use all known data miners in an aggregated fashion.

2. Future Work

Work will be done to import data from Wikipedia, Zeitgeist and NEPOMUK; as provided
by the plugins in this directory. Other sources of information, like the system 
itself and the files on connected devices are also mined and managed by plug-ins
found here.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

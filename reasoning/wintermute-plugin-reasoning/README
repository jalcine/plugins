Wintermute Mining API (WntrMining)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This subproject covers Wintermute's ability to intelligently produce semantic in
formation from multiple, abstract resources. The API is designed to be as flexib
le and dynamic, yet stable and concrete so that backends about file logging and 
world news could both be used in an effective manner. This symbosis of informati
on brings out the concepts of knowledge, and can potentially produce autonomous
knowledge engineering tools for Wintermute.

2. Future Work

The API for the Mining API is still in the drafts, but it's clear that this plug
in alone will rely on WntrData for its need to properly draft semantic informati
on into an ontology.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

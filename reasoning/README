Wintermute's Reasoning API
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This subproject consists of the Wintermute Reasoning API (WntrReasoning). It
gives Wintermute the ability to reason and understand the meaning of semantically
formed statements.

2. Future Work

Need a spec.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers

Wintermute Graphics
=======================

0. Preface

Wintermute is designed to be a 'plug-and-play' sort of system. Systems designed
as such tend to run into serious design issues. Fortunately for Wintermute's
developers; Qt has managed to take care most of the naughty work when dealing
with plug-in control and administering. This plug-in merely represents a hook
being made into the control system and allowing a front-end of sorts to be
implemented.

1. Introduction

This plug-in for Wintermute is designed to provide a graphical user interface
(GUI) to Wintermute. Based mainly on Qt, this plug-in allows end-users to drop
the command line approach of using Wintermute and utilize a visual means of
commandeering their desktop to employ Wintermute's abilities.

2. Current Status

The graphical user interface now harbors a primary interface (although you will
still need to view the console for input/output) with an 'About' dialog
providing links to more information about Wintermute to new users. We currently
dis-encourage any adding of new features unless it's been discussed and
approved by Dante Ashton on the wintermute-devel mailing list at
  <wintermute-devel@lists.launchpad.net>. You can reach Dante Ashton at
    <dante.ashton@thesii.org> if you wish to present a design approach, but
it's recommended that you use the mailing list; this way the team can assist in
designing and developing. 

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

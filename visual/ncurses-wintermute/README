nCurses for Wintermute
=======================

1. Introduction

Curses is a well-known TUI (text user interface) for UNIX systems and is used by
many applications (aptitude, apt-get, etc.) for the manipulation of command-line
use. A typical use of Wintermute's Curses interface would default within 80x30
and would look like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINTERMUTE v0.01 - 30.10.2011 02:32 AM EDT              || TEaR Pane - 00:30.000

W: Hello. ( ~0.000 s )
U: Hello, Wintermute. What's new?
W: I've learned 3,820 concepts. 430 of these concepts are new, while the rest of
    them are enrichments of concepts that I already knew about. For example, did
    you know that Medgar Evers was only 37 years old when he was shot in front of
    his home in Mississippi? ( ~0.157 s )
U: No, I didn't. Who is Medgar Evers.
W: Medgar Evers was a Civil Rights activists in the 1960s and a school teacher.
U: I didn't know that.
W: I didn't either before my last Wikipedia data crawl. ( ~0.096 s )
U: > ___

The sample screen above shows a simple rendering of Wintermute's start page with
a bit about Wintermute, how to start using the interface and a prompt after Wint
ermute greeting the user. It also shows a bit of dialogue between Wintermute and
the user. The key components of the screen is the (1) status bar, (2) title bar
and (3) context pane. Those each have their own means of having data inserted 
into them and can be done asynchronously of each other. This provides a producti
ve and flexible interface.

2. Keybindings

Being that it's a textual user interface based on Curses, keybindings makes the
using of the application tremendously easier. All of the keybindings for the con
sole interface (whether defined or not) are listed below. 

Global:

  ^h or ^?             : Shows the help pane.
  ^s                   : Shows the settings pane.
  ^q                   : Quits the application.
  
Navigation:
  <ENTER>              : Closes a dialog window (if any).
  <BACKSPACE> or <ESC> : Goes back to the previous window
  UP ARROW             : Shows one less line of text in the context pane.
  DOWN ARROW           : Shows one more line of text in the context pane.
  PAGE UP              : Jumps up one screen's worth of lines in the context
                         pane.
  PAGE DOWN            : Jumps down one screen's worth of lines in the context
                         pane.
                         
Text Entry and Retriveal (TEaR) window:
  <ENTER>              : Used to signify the end of user input.
  ^v                   : Toggles the verbosity of Wintermute's output.

1. Introduction

This folder contains the plug-ins representing different executions levels of Wi
ntermute. These plug-ins edit the capabilities and work-flow of Wintermute and 
are typically run before a lot of other plug-ins. These plug-ins define Wintermu
te's level within the AngelNet hierarchy.

These plug-ins are crucial to the execution of Wintermute to the point where at
least _one_ of these plug-ins have to be running in order for Wintermute to full
y reach its potential.

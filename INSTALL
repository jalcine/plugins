Installing Plug-ins for Wintermute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing plug-ins for Wintermute is typically a one-tier process but can be a
double-tier if its dependant API hasn't been installed yet. Each folder names
a specific API of Wintermute (vision for computer vision, semantics for the Ange
lNet) and its child plug-ins. 

Those who wish to quickly build Wintermute's frontend will need to do the follow
ing:

    1. Navigate to the folder with all of the APIs in a terminal.
    
    2. Run the following commands:
        $ cd visual/wintermute-plugin-frontend
        $ mkdir -p build && cd build
        $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
        $ make
        # make install
        $ cd ../gui-wintermute
        $ make
        # make install
        
    3. Run Wintermute by entering:
        $ wintermute

Predator Adaptor for Wintermute
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This project provides Wintermute with the Predator algorithm, a object-tracking
recognition system designed using GNU Octave.

2. Future Work

Work will be done to integrate the OpenTLD code based on the Predator
algorithm for live face and object recognition. This code will be a derivation
of the original work done by using Octave, now instead by using OpenCV and
Qt.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

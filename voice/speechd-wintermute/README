Speech Dispatcher support for Wintermute
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

Speech Dispatcher (http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd) is a means of providing
a device independent layer for speech synthesis. Using back-ends, it provides
support for many other speech synthesizers. Wintermute uses Speech Dispatcher
to allow users of "lite" systems (i.e.: Lubuntu) to have text read to them on
the screen and implement vocal cues.

2. Current Implementation

Very little work has been done to implement this plug-in as of yet.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

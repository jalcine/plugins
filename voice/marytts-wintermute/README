MARY TTS for Wintermute [Voice Backend : Output] (WntrVoice Backend)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

MARY (http://mary.dfki.de) provides a powerful, efficient, and open-source
speech synthesizer written in Java with a collection of effective voice
models under OSI-approved licenses like the MIT or BSD license. Wintermute
uses this speech synthesizer by default for all of its synthesizing needs.

2. Current Implementation

Since MARY runs as a web server and returns either a WAV, MP3 or an AAC file
as its result or plain-text on an error, we don't do have to do much in-house
work. The means of communicating with the server on the HTTP level is
handled by libmarytts-qt, a library crafed to communicate with it designed by
Jacky Alcine and is available at <https://github.com/jalcine/marytts-qt>.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to

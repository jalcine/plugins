Wintermute Voice API (WntrVoice)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This subproject covers Wintermute's ability to transform audio into text and visa
versa. The API merely serves as a means of simplifying said processes so that it's
done in parallel and in a "don't ask, don't tell" fashion. The API allows individuals
to mask text with prosody and annotations so that the output stream sounds exactly as
intended. The input text would also be working closely with WntrLing in order to provide
a semantically correct sentence, avoiding ambiguity.

2. Future Work

Work is being done to add support for more of the well-known and familiar speech
synthesizers like eSpeak and Festival, for users with low-power systems or who
wish not to use MARY, the recommended and default speech synthesizer of Wintermute.
Other people may use Julius in conjunction of using Simon, as opposed to CMU Sphinx,
also the recommended and default speech recognizer of Wintermute. With an addition of
tools, we expect to get more (and potentially, varying) experience results from users
about Wintermute.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible

Wintermute Plug-in Collections (WntrPlugins)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This project represents all of the known plug-ins for Wintermute. Having all of
the plug-ins centralized allows us to make immediate and rapid changes to code
given that the code-base changes. This also allows potential plug-in developers
to extend upon what's already available and experiment with their own creations.

2. Future Work

The graphical user interface plug-in may be dragged into this sub-branch IF the
developers here at Wintermute consider it to be a good plug-in. It's a bit more
than a plug-in, currently Wintermute expects it to be on the system. A link to
the current discussion will be embedded in this document at the latest copy of
the revision, available at <https://www.github.com/wntr/gui>.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible

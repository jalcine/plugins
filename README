Wintermute Plug-in Collections (WntrPlugins)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This project represents all of the known plug-ins for Wintermute. Having all of
the plug-ins centralized allows us to make immediate and rapid changes to code
given that the code-base changes. This also allows potential plug-in developers
to extend upon what's already available and experiment with their own creations.

2. Current Status

At the moment, thee directory will only contain a prototypical plug-in called
'sample'. It will be searched for by Wintermute and loaded merely to
demonstrate the ability and possibility of implementing code for Wintermute.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

Wintermute Plug-in Collections (WntrPlugins)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This project represents all of the known plug-ins for Wintermute. Having all of
the plug-ins centralized allows us to make immediate and rapid changes to code
given that the code-base changes. This also allows potential plug-in developers
to extend upon what's already available and experiment with their own creations.

2. Layout

Certain folders contain subprojects that represent a base plugin that provides an
API (i.e: WntrVoice, WntrVision) and its backends that provide functionality to it.
There's over 15 plug-ins available in these folders, but the average user may only
take advantage of 9 or 10 of them. The rest add miscellaneous functionality to
Wintermute that may not be directly useful but otherwise improve performance.

In the future, it should be possible to build all of the plug-ins in a monolithic manner.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

Wintermute's Vision API (WntrVision + backends)
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This subproject consists of the Wintermute Vision API (WntrVision) and its accompanying
backends. WntrVision attempts to provide information to Wintermute about its
environment from web cameras or other live video streams. The source of
input is not limited to that, but potentially can originate from there.
The API provides a way of using computer vision in an abstracted way (an backend
for text, another for facial recognition, etc.), thus giving it the flexibility
to provide as much data as possible in a parallel fashion due to the fact that
plugins run independently of each other.

2. Future Work

Work will be done to integrate the OpenTLD code based on the Predator
algorithm for live face and object recognition. This code will be a derivation
of the original work done by using Octave, now instead by using OpenCV and
Qt.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
hear (or see or read) from you soon.

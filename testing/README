Wintermute Testing
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

This projects contains a bunch of tests, regression utilities and other means of
testing to ensure that Wintermute's plug-in system is working in tip-top shape.

2. Mission

The idea of this plug-in to have it work in two parts:


    1) Pre-Build: Before it builds, it searches for proper utilities needed to b
                  uild a plug-in for Wintermute. Utilities like Qt's development
                  suite and dependencies for other plug-ins, if extending their
                  functionality. The results are dumped for development usage.
                  
    2) Build:     While it's building, any typical error related to mismatching 
                  code (i.e.: using legacy code), would be reported and dumped
                  for development usage.
                  
    3) Run-time:  Any errors related to having Wintermute stop operating (i.e: a
                  segfault in a plug-in or the core due to bad code) would be ca
                  ught and dumped for usage.
